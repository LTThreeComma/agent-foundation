"""OAuth credentials of MCP connections, and the HTTP client every MCP connection's requests go through.

`authorize` starts the authorization-code flow with PKCE in the browser; a client registered in advance with the
client-credentials grant instead requests its token as the connection's one operation (`authorize_client`). The
callback exchanges the code as one operation too. The credential is the client the grant was made to and changes
only with a new authorization; its tokens are renewed on use without a new connection version: with the refresh
token, or for a client-credentials client by asking again. Renewal is a connection operation: one owner sends it
and concurrent users wait for its result. A lost response that may have rotated the refresh token needs
reauthorization instead of presenting the old token again; a request that was never sent keeps the credential.
A grant a new authorization replaced is revoked as a best effort unless it was made to the same client of the
same issuer, whose revocation could end the new grant too.
